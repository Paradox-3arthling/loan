# Loan

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
  
  * Purpose is to make a system that manages a user's clients to whom they have loaned money...
     ... currently works on assumption of 30 days period... will make it dynamic soon
  * In future maybe a platform for letting user's be able to loan to one another and being updated 
    on people who iwe you
